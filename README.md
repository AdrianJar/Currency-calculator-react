## 📖Description 

Hello everyone, I’d like to show you my "Currency calculator" application.

So „Currency calculator" is a web application which allows you to calulate how much money in ZŁ is worth at 3 currencies: 
1. USD
2. EURO
3. GBP

My web applications contains of 1 input 1 select and 2 buttons which are responsible for:

-  Input is responsible inserting amount in zł currency which we want to transfer. 
-  Select is responsible for choosing to which currency we want to calculate our amount. You can choose from 3 which are mentioned before.
-  "Przelicz" Button is responsible for calculating amount of money in zł to one which you choose.
-  "Reset" Button is responsilbe for restarting APP to it's starting position. Resets input, currency and value.

This web APP is a part of my Frontend Dev course in which I participate.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
